# plotly_project

- This repository contains an interactive dashboard visualizing the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

- The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

- Tools utilized to create this dashboard: D3, plotly.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS 

- The full dashboard is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: https://mvaldes27.github.io/plotly-project/
